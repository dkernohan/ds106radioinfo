How to... 
1. See who is on air right now?
You can see the soundcraft currently playing by checking this Icecast server page -> 
http://ds106rad.io:8000 

It currently does NOT indicate if there is a live broadcast going on (a work in progress) (we promise)


2. Listen to DS106radio

Computer
Easiest option is via the web page http://ds106rad.io/listen/

To use a non-browser option use a media player such as VLC, iTunes, Winamp. Download the .pls file and tell the media player to use it (VLC seems to be the most reliable player: http://www.videolan.org/vlc/)

Mobile
Any: Tune-in Radio - download from Google Play or iTunes Store http://tunein.com/mobile/
Search for DS106Radio to tune in

iPhone: Fstream, RadioLite; 

Android: LeadappsAndroidRadio2.0

3. Prepare for upcoming show or to broadcast at a specific time. 
We use Twitter to self organize our broadcasting schedule on the fly by hashtag #ds106radio
Follow @ds106radio (The twitter bot is current MIA)

4. Broadcast Live
There are several programs available to stream live. If someone else is currently live you will receive an error if you try to broadcast.

Broadcasting Software
Windows:
 * Use Winamp with EdCast - see walkthrough http://goo.gl/M23O9)
 * Install Mixxx http://www.mixxx.org/
Mac 
 * Download Nicecast for mac  http://www.rogueamoeba.com/nicecast/
 * Ladiocast (rhymes with Radio-cast) http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/27022/ladiocast
   * best pronounced "Laaaaaaaady-Oooooooh-cast"
Ubuntu Linux:
 * Install Mixxx: Open up a terminal:
   * sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mixxx/mixxx
   * sudo apt-get update
   * sudo apt-get install mixxx libportaudio2
Linux (manual)
 - I used Slackware:
 * Dependencies: http://www.mixxx.org/wiki/doku.php/compiling_on_linux#install_build_dependencies 
 * If you're compiling it all manually, make sure you don't have speex installed when you compile libshout. It took me hours to figure out why scons wouldn't detect libshout. Apparently speex breaks it.
Mobile:
 * Papaya Broadcaster (iOS) (No longer available)
http://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/papaya-broadcaster/id366266882?mt=8
 * KoalaSan (new app, also auto archives)

How do I add my creations?


It’s On Us to Manage ds106radio (how to upload and program) http://cogdogblog.com/2013/07/01/manage-ds106-radio/
So You Want to Help Manage ds106 radio (more details, screencasts, pleading) http://cogdogblog.com/2013/08/01/help-manage-ds106-radio/



Also, your files should have a title and artist name—be  sure that this metadata is that it can be included in the sidebar  announcements and ds106radio tweets (coming soon)! If it isn’t there,  use any standard players listed above to add it. 


Bumpers and commercials
We very much encourage you to create content for ds106 radio, and once  you listen you’ll notice there are some fun examples of user-generated bumpers, presentations set to music, mashed up culture, film sound bytes, a general mashup of what we have been fed all these years, but more than that how we are learning to “play the feedback” (as Gardner Campbell  notes). Create some art for ds106 and be sure to name your general bumper something like "bumper_zombieradio.mp3" for just straight bumpers, or something more specific for sets, like  "80smovies_bumper_stepfather.mp3". Make sense?

How do I create a set?

How can I get #ds106radio on my site/blog

Radio Stations We Cross Cast
ds106 radio can be programmed to play live streams from other internet radio stations. Help expand our collection by identifying public mp3 streams we can add (add link to details on adding a radio stream).

Note that this MUST be a URL that ill play the media directly, not a .m3u or .pls url which loads into a media player (note though that you can open those files with a text editor, and find the stream URLs).  This is not a request list, we know you want KEXP but they do not have a live mp3 stream.

The test is when you paste the URL in a browser, it plays immediately (not through some flash player).
